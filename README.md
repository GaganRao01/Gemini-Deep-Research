## üìñ Overview

Gemini Deep Research is a powerful, autonomous research system that leverages Google's Gemini LLM to generate comprehensive, detailed reports on any topic. The system performs extensive web research, producing thoroughly researched reports with proper citations, in-depth analysis, and academic rigor.

## üîé Project Files

| File | Purpose |

- üìä **Consolidated References** - All citations organized in a single, properly formatted reference section

## üöÄ Research Depth Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Equivalent Length | Default Queries | Default Results per Query |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Basic | Concise but informative overview | 5-7 pages | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | Detailed | Thorough analysis with significant depth | 10-15 pages | 5 | 3 |
| 3 | Comprehensive | Exhaustive, publication-quality report | 20-30 pages | 8 | 4 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Recommended: Using the Simplified Gemini Implementation

```bash
# Basic research
python gemini_research.py -c "Future of renewable energy" --depth 1

# Detailed research
python gemini_research.py -c "Impact of artificial intelligence on education" --depth 2

# Comprehensive research
python gemini_research.py -c "Quantum computing applications in cryptography" --depth 3
```

### Command Line Arguments for gemini_research.py

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `-c, --context` | The research topic (required) | N/A |
| `--depth` | Research depth level (1=basic, 2=detailed, 3=comprehensive) | 1 |
| `-q, --queries` | Number of search queries to generate (optional) | Based on depth |
| `-r, --results` | Number of results per query (optional) | Based on depth |
| `-s, --site` | Limit searches to a specific site (e.g., 'nature.com') | None |
| `--verbose` | Verbosity level (0=minimal, 1=regular, 2=debug) | 1 |

## üîç How It Works

1. **Query Generation**: The system generates diverse search queries covering different aspects of your research topic
2. **Web Search**: For each query, it searches the web using Google Custom Search API
3. **Content Extraction**: For each search result, it scrapes the content and extracts relevant information
4. **Report Synthesis**: All collected information is synthesized into a comprehensive report
5. **Final Output**: The report is displayed and saved as a markdown file

### How gemini_research.py Works

The `gemini_research.py` script processes research in several key steps:

1. **Search Query Generation**: Uses Google Gemini AI to create tailored search queries that cover different aspects of your research topic
2. **Web Research**: Performs Google searches with the generated queries and collects results
3. **Content Scraping**: Extracts relevant content from web pages using newspaper3k and BeautifulSoup
4. **Date Extraction**: Analyzes content to identify and prioritize the most recent information
5. **Sectional Report Creation**: Organizes research into a standardized structure:
   - Executive Summary and Introduction
   - Main Content Sections (tailored to the topic)
   - Dedicated Challenges and Limitations section
   - Future Directions section
   - Conclusion
   - Consolidated References section
6. **Formatting Standardization**: Ensures consistent heading styles, section numbering, and citation format
7. **Output Generation**: Produces a comprehensive markdown report with proper academic structure

The sectional approach ensures reports maintain a logical flow and professional structure regardless of topic complexity or research depth.

> **Note**: Due to the current chunking and splitting approach used in report generation, some topics may be repeated across sections. We're aware of this limitation and plan to improve it in future updates.

## üìã Example Output

The research tool generates a comprehensive, well-structured report on the specified topic. The report includes:

- Executive summary
- Introduction to the topic
- Multiple sections exploring different aspects of the topic
- Analysis of key findings
- Challenges and limitations
- Future directions and research opportunities  
- Conclusion
- Consolidated references

### Sample Report Included

This repository includes a sample report on "Quantum Computing Applications in Cryptography" generated at depth level 3. This approximately 20,000-word report demonstrates the capabilities of the platform and follows the standardized structure:

- Executive Summary and Introduction
- Comprehensive sections on quantum computing fundamentals
- Detailed analysis of quantum threats to classical cryptography
- In-depth coverage of post-quantum cryptography standardization
- Exploration of quantum key distribution technologies
- Dedicated sections on implementation challenges and limitations
- Future research directions
- Conclusion synthesizing the research
- Properly formatted references
